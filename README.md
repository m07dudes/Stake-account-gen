## 📘 About This Project

This repository explains **how reverse engineering works at a high level**, including:

* Understanding how websites communicate (requests & responses)
* How automation scripts are structured
* How data is passed using JSON
* Learning configuration-based logic

All examples are **theoretical, non-functional, and for learning only**.

---

## 🧠 What You Learn

* Reverse engineering basics
* Automation workflow structure
* JSON data handling
* Proxy & email service concepts (theory only)
